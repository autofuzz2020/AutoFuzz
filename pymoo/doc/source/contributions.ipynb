    "- **New features:** For instance new test problems, algorithms, or any other multi-objective related implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Termination Criteria:** We have implemented rudimentary 'x_tol' and 'f_tol' termination criteria. However, a study needs to be made if those are suitable for test and/or for real-world problems. Also, what default parameter settings are suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constraint Handling:** So far mostly parameter-less constraint handling is used. Many different strategies of handling constraints have been studied and the some state of the art methods should be provided in *pymoo* as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interactive Visualization:** Our framework provides static visualization for the objective space in higher dimensions. However, it would be nice to make it possible to interactively explore solutions. A good choice would be a web based application with a javascript/typescript based interface using *pymoo* to answer requests necessary for plotting or optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other Topcis:** Those are topics that came to our mind. However, there are many more things related to multi-objective optimization that are interesting and standard implementation in a framework would be useful!"
