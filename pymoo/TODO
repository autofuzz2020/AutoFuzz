# TODO


- Write test suite for all algorithms (many problems just run once - no crash should occur)

- Add global tests of all optimization methods

- 1+1 and archive




####################################################################

# DONE
- Report None of infeasible or feasible
- Algorithm workflow - initialize, run, finalize --  solve does everything
- Infill Criteria Class  and Mating inherits from it
- NSGA3 - add non-dom check finally (factor out the algorithm method and reuse)
- !!! NDS and crowding cast to np.float
- !!! Rewrite integer operation with a wrapper - check if casting is working for different types
- copy of algorithm object when minimize is called
- Add sidebar to homepage
- Decision Making (Pseudo Weight, ...)
- Termination Criteria in x space and fspace - xtol and ftol
- PCP values do have different ranges
- Add ZDT5 and show it for NSGA2
- 0.9 prob for crossover in general
- add normalization to radar - externalize from pcp
- Performance check nsga3
- Deliver just .c files for pip to make the build independent from Cython
- Compilation issue with MacOSX Macoave
- NSGA3 worst swap of arguments
- maybe include CMA-ES: https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma
- Add NoCrossover and NoMutation
- Add mixed variable possibility

# Future


- PCX as crossover
- Remove image file from git history
- (mu,lambda) and (mu+lambda) difference
- Statistics of Survival and more attributes for individuals
- ask and tell interface Documentation
- Implement an async version of algorithms
