Benchmark
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains an example benchmark setup for algorithms. It is constructed to be executed
on a single-machine with many cores. Since most of the algorithm execute pretty fast we did
not setup a distributed system for our benchmarking yet.


1. Run the corresponding benchmark file which will create the configuration into the
pymoo/benchmark/runs folder. You will find for a run a persisted configuration and a batch file
run.bat that contains a line to run each configuration.

2. The framework must be available where you execute the benchmark. Either you use the globally
installed pymoo through pip or if you are developing a new algorithm you need to import the
local project. To do so, open pymoo/benchmark/execute.py and make sure that the folder to
pymoo is imported correctly. E.g.

sys.path.insert(0, "/home/blankjul/workspace/pymoo/")



Serialized
========================

In order to run all algorithms serialized you can now simply execute:

cd pymoo/benchmark
sh runs/<algorithm>/run.bat

This will run all algorithms in a row. Be careful to be in the benchmark folder.


Multi Processes
========================

For parallelization you can use the runner.py by provided the path to the run.bat and the number
processes to be used.

python runner.py runs/<algorithm>/run.bat 32

To run it on 32 processes.
